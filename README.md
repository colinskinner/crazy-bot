# crazy-bot

So basically I decided to make a bot because I was bored one day trying to procrastinate English (my AR proposal to the Aerospace department).

Currently it has a bit of profanity (forgive me future employers), but given time it should have some more features and be a little more child friendly. I tried to include helpful code comments like Nikhil suggested.
